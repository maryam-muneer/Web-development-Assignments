        <h1>About Me</h1>
    </div>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>I am an assistant professor of computer science at Amherst College. My main research interests are in theoretical
        computer science, particularly distributed computing, the design and analysis of efficient algorithms, and
        computational complexity.
    </p>
    <h2>Biographical Sketch </h2>
    <p>I did a lot of bouncing around before coming to Amherst. Here is a brief outline:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> I was born in Seattle, WA and grew up in the Seattle suburbs.</li>
        <li>After high school, I went to Reed College in Portland, OR, where I majored in mathematics.</li>
        <li>I then continued to pursue mathematics in graduate school at UCLA. While there, I learned that many of the
            mathematical problems I was most excited about working on were inspired by problems in computer science.
        </li>
        <li> After completing my PhD at UCLA, I did postdocs at Tel Aviv University in Israel and the Max Planck
            Institute for Informatics in Saarbrücken, Germany.</li>
        <li>I then joined the Amherst College computer science department in Fall 2020.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, cooking, hiking, and taking pictures.</p>
    <h2>Something Unique</h2>
    <p>I'll leave you with something people might be surprised to learn about me. Before I graduated from college, I had
        three different jobs:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li> snowboard instructor</li>
        <li>fisher</li>
        <li>nuclear reactor operator</li>
    </ol>
